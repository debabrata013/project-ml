- Gets city, country, latitude, longitude
- No manual input required
- Location-specific recommendations

### 2. 🌡️ **Real-time Weather Data**
- Current temperature
- Humidity levels
- Wind conditions
- Precipitation
- Weather conditions

### 3. 🗓️ **7-Day Weather Forecast**
- Temperature trends
- Precipitation predictions
- Wind patterns
- Weather changes

### 4. 🤖 **AI-Powered Recommendations**

- Crop protection strategies
- Irrigation scheduling
- Risk assessments
- Emergency preparedness

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **API Integration:**
```python
def weather_farming_advisor(input_data: str = None) -> dict:
    # 1. Get location automatically
    location = get_current_location()
    
    # 2. Get current weather
    current_weather = get_current_weather("")
    
    # 3. Get forecast
    forecast = get_weather_forecast("")
    
    # 4. Generate AI recommendations
    ai_recommendations = generate_recommendations(
        location, current_weather, forecast
    )
    
    return {
        "location": location,
        "weather": current_weather,
        "forecast": forecast,
        "recommendations": ai_recommendations
    }
```

### **Weather Data Sources:**
- OpenWeather API for current conditions
- OpenWeather Forecast API for predictions
- IP-API for location detection
